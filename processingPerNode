-- Node Level processing and Bytes percentage to check which node may be processing more slowly than the rest or more data is being processed on certain nodes.
-- break down the query for a specific time or specific query and its steps if needed.
-- Use this query to see if there is more bytes processed on one node and is also taking more execution time.
-- If the bytes processed are more we can see over slowness in the system as we are not taking full advantage of a parallel system.
-- Do also look at commit level inforamtion per node to see if certain nodes are commiting more.
-- Check stl_commit_stats for commit info per node.
